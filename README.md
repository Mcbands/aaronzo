```

Your terminal prompt should change, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## 5. Create a Superuser (Optional)

Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in your web browser to see your Django project.

Happy coding!
